# Memory card matching game

Players initially see 16 cards face down on the play field. Only two cards at a time can be turned.
If turned cards don't match, they will turn back over. Once two turned cards match, they remain face up
on the play field. The game is won, when all cards are matched.

I've written this project as a part of Front End Nanodegree program at [Udacity](https://www.udacity.com/).

I've modified the premade HTML and CSS, but my **primary goal** was to write **_Javascript_**, that would run the game.

## Features:

+ This version of the game keeps track of player's moves and calculates star rating accordingly.    
+ The game keeps track of time.
+ The game can be restarted anytime.
+ Once all cards are matched the game displays results summary and offers to start the game over.

## Please feel free to test run the game by clicking **[here](https://wkdavid.github.io/CardMatchingGame/)**
+ Alternatively, you can [download the project](https://github.com/WKDavid/CardMatchingGame/archive/master.zip)
+ or clone it <https://github.com/WKDavid/CardMatchingGame.git>, then run _index.html_ and enjoy the game ;)
