# Memory card matching game

I've written this project as a part of Front End Nanodegree program at [Udacity](https://www.udacity.com/).

I've modified the premade HTML and CSS, but my **primary goal** was to write **_Javascript_**, that would run the game.

## Features:

+ This version of the game keeps track of player's moves and calculates star rating accordingly.    
+ The game keeps track of time.
+ The game can be restarted anytime.
+ Once all cards are matched the game displays results summary and offers to start the game over.

## Please feel free to test run the game by clicking **[here](https://wkdavid.github.io/CardMatchingGame/)**
